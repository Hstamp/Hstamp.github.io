<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And first of all I want to thank you for the support you&rsquo;ve given me in the past ten months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a time of great change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m already on my second leader of the Liberal Democrats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before long I&rsquo;ll be on to my second Labour Prime Minister.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Soon I&rsquo;ll be the longest-serving leader of a major British political party.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wanted this job for a very simple reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love this country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have great ambitions for our future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I want the Party I love&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;to serve the country I love&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;in helping Britain be the best that it can.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need to change in order to have that chance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You cannot shape the future if you&rsquo;re stuck in the past.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You knew that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why you voted for change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe we can all be proud of what we&rsquo;ve achieved these past ten months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People looking at us with new interest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>25,000 new members.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in our first electoral test, in the local elections, we won forty per cent of the vote.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hear it for our fantastic local councillors who worked so hard and won so well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tony Blair says it&rsquo;s all style and no substance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact he wrote me a letter about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear Kettle&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re black.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Signed, Pot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What a nerve that man has got.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the whole of the last year, there is only one substantial thing that the Labour Party has achieved for our country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their education reforms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now, across the country, trust schools are being prepared with greater freedoms to teach children the way teachers and parents want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only reason &ndash; the only reason - that&rsquo;s happening is because the Conservative Party did the right thing and took the legislation through the House of Commons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m proud of that &ndash; proud of us, for putting the future of our children before party politics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another sign of our changing fortunes is the impressive array of speakers who have come to join us at our conference this year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SENATOR McCAIN</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;d like to pay a special tribute to one in particular.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a man who knows about leadership.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s endured hardship that&rsquo;s unimaginable to many of us here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s fought battles for principles that we all admire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who knows what the future may hold?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But John, I for one would be proud to see you &ndash; a great American and a great friend to Britain - as leader of the free world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>COLLEAGUES</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to pay tribute to my colleagues who have spoken already today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A year ago, David Davis and I were rivals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today we&rsquo;re partners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He has given me the most fantastic support over these past ten months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ideas, energy, advice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He has not only helped bring this Party together&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;he has helped take our Party in the right direction, and I want to thank him for all he&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m proud to work with another man who is a brave politician, a wise counsellor and a great Conservative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A man who would be a Foreign Secretary that this country could be truly proud of: William Hague.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s Francis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know Francis likes to pretend that everything is doom and gloom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s always talking about the mountain we have to climb.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s so gloomy, he makes Gordon Brown look like a ray of sunshine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Francis, you&rsquo;re doing a great job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LABOUR SPLITS AND BACKSTABBING</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course Francis has long told us to avoid the point-scoring and name-calling that can give politics such a bad name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we didn&rsquo;t bargain on the Labour Party.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First Gordon said he could never trust Tony again, then Tony called Gordon a blackmailer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Charles said Gordon was stupid, then John popped up and said no, Tony was stupid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Charles called Gordon a deluded control freak.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And a member of the Cabinet said &ldquo;it would be an absolute effing disaster&rdquo; if Gordon got to No.10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That was just the husbands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I look at these Labour ministers I ask myself how much time they&rsquo;re worrying about their own jobs&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;and how much time they&rsquo;re worrying about NHS, about crime, about our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You only have to ask the question to know what the answer is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And there are months more of it still to come.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Months of infighting, instability, indecision, jockeying for position&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They said it would be a &ldquo;stable and orderly transition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like they said &ldquo;24 hours to save the NHS&rdquo;, &ldquo;education education education.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the things they should be fighting for, but they&rsquo;re too busy fighting each other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OUR RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So we have a great responsibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To set out a clear, united and credible alternative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With some elections, you just know the result before a single vote has been cast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We were never going to win in 1997.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People wanted change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember it well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I fought Stafford.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And Stafford fought back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Labour were never going to win in 1983 when they offered Michael Foot as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other elections are wide open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the next election will be one of those.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we will not win, nor deserve to win, without a clear purpose and a proper plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We must learn from Labour&rsquo;s big mistake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Tony Blair won his first election, he had only one clear purpose: to win a second term.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even now he says that the only legacy &ndash; the only legacy - that really matters to him is Labour winning a fourth term.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back in 1997, he had no proper plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No real understanding of how to make change happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He had good intentions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But he hadn&rsquo;t worked out how to deliver them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So New Labour went round and round in circles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They abolished grant maintained schools - and now they&rsquo;re trying to recreate them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They reversed our NHS reforms - and now they&rsquo;re trying to bring them back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Road building &ndash; cancelled, then reinstated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They wasted time, wasted money, wasted the country&rsquo;s goodwill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only now, after nine years, does Tony Blair seem clear about his purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well I&rsquo;m sorry Mr Blair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s nine years too late.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THIS WEEK</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t make the same mistake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the last day of our conference, I want to talk in detail about the important issues we face as a nation &ndash; and what our response will be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But today, on this first day of our conference, I&rsquo;d like to set the scene for our discussions this week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to explain how we will arrive at the next election knowing exactly what we want to do, and how we&rsquo;re going to do it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My argument is based on a simple analogy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Getting ready for the responsibility of government is like building a house together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think of it in three stages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First you prepare the ground.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you lay the foundations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then, finally, brick by brick, you build your house.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PREPARING THE GROUND</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These last ten months, we have been preparing the ground.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Party&rsquo;s history tells us the ground on which political success is built.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is the centre ground.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not the bog of political compromise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not the ideological wilderness, out on the fringes of debate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the solid ground where people are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The centre ground is where you find the concerns, the hopes and the dreams of most people and families in this country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1979, they wanted a government to tame the unions, rescue our economy and restore Britain&rsquo;s pride.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Margaret Thatcher offered precisely that alternative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And this Party can forever take pride in her magnificent achievements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, people want different things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The priorities are different.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Safer streets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Schools that teach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A better quality of life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Better treatment for carers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what people are talking about today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But for too long, we were having a different conversation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of talking about the things that most people care about, we talked about what we cared about most.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While parents worried about childcare, getting the kids to school, balancing work and family life - we were banging on about Europe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As they worried about standards in thousands of secondary schools, we obsessed about a handful more grammar schools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As rising expectations demanded a better NHS for everyone, we put our faith in opt-outs for a few.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While people wanted, more than anything, stability and low mortgage rates, the first thing we talked about was tax cuts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For years, this country wanted &ndash; desperately needed - a sensible centre-right party to sort things out in a sensible way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s what we are today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In these past ten months we have moved back to the ground on which this Party&rsquo;s success has always been built.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The centre ground of British politics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that is where we will stay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LAYING THE FOUNDATIONS &ndash; SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But preparing the ground is just the first stage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now we must show what we will build there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A strong government needs strong foundations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I want us to lay those foundations this week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not about individual policies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is about a vision of the Britain we want to see.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Britain where we do not just ask what government can do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We ask what people can do, what society can do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Britain where we stop thinking you can pass laws to make people good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And start realising that we are all in this together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Social responsibility &ndash; that is the essence of liberal Conservatism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is the idea I want us to explain this week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is what we stand for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is what we&rsquo;re fighting for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is the Britain we want to build.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take fighting crime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not just a state responsibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a social responsibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not pretend that all we need is tough talk and tough laws to bring safety to our streets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course the state must play its part.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re developing a programme of radical police reform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we want to build more prisons and reform the ones we&rsquo;ve got, so they help reduce re-offending instead of encouraging it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ll invest in drug rehabilitation, so we help addicts get clean and stay clean, instead of living a life of crime to feed their habit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But that is not the end of the story.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is just the start.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need parents to bring up their children with the right values.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need schools to be places of discipline and order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need to stand up for civilised values in public places.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need to design crime out of the housing estates of the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got to stop selling alcohol to children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need the music industry to understand that profiting from violent and homophobic words and images is morally wrong and socially unacceptable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But more than this, we need people, families, communities, businesses to step up to the plate and understand that it&rsquo;s not just about stopping the bad things&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;it&rsquo;s about actively doing the good things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not waiting for the state to do it all, but taking responsibility, making a difference, saying loudly and proudly: this is my country, this is my community: I will play my part.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is social responsibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is our idea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I want us to be the champions of a new spirit of social responsibility in this land.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A new spirit of social responsibility that will succeed for Britain where Labour&rsquo;s outdated state responsibility has failed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LABOUR&rsquo;S APPROACH</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think of any issue - not just crime - and then think of Labour&rsquo;s response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Government&rsquo;s way of doing things &ndash; the old way of doing things - is so familiar, and so depressing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ministers hold a summit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They announce an eye-catching initiative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A five-year plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gordon Brown generously finds the money for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The money gets a headline, but no-one knows what to do with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So they create a unit in the Cabinet Office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A task force is set up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regional co-ordinators are appointed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gordon Brown sets them targets &ndash; after all, it is his money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pilot schemes are launched.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pilot schemes are rolled out across the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are evaluated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then revised, re-organised and re-launched.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then finally, once the reality dawns that the only people to benefit are the lawyers, accountants and consultants of Labour&rsquo;s quango army&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;with a pathetic whimper &ndash; but no hint of an apology &ndash; the whole thing is just abandoned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen too much of this in the past nine years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Headline after headline but absolutely no follow-through.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a story of ignorance, incompetence, arrogance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A story of wasted billions - and disappointed millions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Somewhere out there, there is a place where Blair and Brown will never go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dark.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s depressing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s haunted by the failures of nine years of centralisation, gimmick and spin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is the graveyard of initiatives, where you&rsquo;ll find the e-University that died a death,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the drugs czar that came and went&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;the Individual Learning Accounts that collapsed in fraud and waste, the tax credits that were paid and reclaimed&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;the Connexions service that flopped, the Strategic Health Authorities that were dropped&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;the marching of yobs to the hole in the wall; the night courts that never happened at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And still they keep coming, those hubristic monuments to big government, the living dead that walk the well-trodden path from Downing Street and the Treasury to New Labour&rsquo;s graveyard of initiatives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NHS computer: delayed, disorganised, a &pound;20 billion shambles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Forced police mergers: the direct opposite of the community policing we need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then the perfect example.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ID cards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a half-way competent government would be protecting our security by controlling our borders&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;these Labour ministers are pressing ahead with their vast white elephant, their plastic poll tax, twenty Millennium Domes rolled into one giant catastrophe in the making.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve given up trying to find a good reason for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last week Tony Blair said that ID cards would help control immigration, when new immigrants won&rsquo;t even have them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does he even know what&rsquo;s going on in his Government?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ID cards are wrong, they&rsquo;re a waste of money, and we will abolish them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These last nine years have been the story of a Government which instinctively believes, whatever it says, that everything is the state&rsquo;s responsibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe in social responsibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because there is such a thing as society, it&rsquo;s just not the same thing as the state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE BRITAIN WE WANT TO SEE</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So let us define this week the kind of Britain we want to see.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And let us show how our idea &ndash; social responsibility&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;not Labour&rsquo;s idea &ndash; state responsibility&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;is the right response to the challenges Britain faces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GLOBALISATION, WELL-BEING, THE ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know that in the age of globalisation, in the face of fast-moving economic change, people want their government to provide security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know that the end of the traditional 9 to 5 job can make life tough for families, and people look to their government for answers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And we know that in the race against time to tackle climate change and protect the environment, people expect their government to show leadership.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On all these challenges, Labour&rsquo;s first response is to regulate business, hoping to offer protection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may sound attractive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But there are unintended consequences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well-intentioned regulation can make us less secure in the age of globalisation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Less able to provide the jobs, wealth and opportunity on which well-being depends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It can undermine the competitiveness of our companies, so it&rsquo;s harder for them to invest in the new, green technologies of the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So our response, based on our philosophy of social responsibility, is to say to business:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes you should look after your workers, yes you should look after your community, yes you should look after our environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And we must stand up to big business when it&rsquo;s in the interests of Britain and the wider world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So next week our MEPs will vote to strengthen proposals to make companies replace dangerous chemicals with safe ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But where Labour are casual about increasing regulation, we will be careful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will ask:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are we making it easier to start a business?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Easier to employ someone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the overall burden of regulation going down?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will the regulation that&rsquo;s being put forward lead to real changes in behaviour, or just time-wasting and box-ticking?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If only we had a government that was asking these questions today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want companies to create their own solutions to social and environmental challenges, because those are the solutions most likely to last.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So in a Conservative Britain, corporate responsibility will provide the best long-term answer to economic insecurity, well-being in the workplace, and environmental care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is the same approach when you look at the other great challenges we face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PUBLIC SERVICES</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know that in an age of amazing technological advance, instant information exchange, and empowered consumers who don&rsquo;t have the deference of previous generations&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;people expect more from our health service and our schools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And government has to respond to that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Labour&rsquo;s response is the culture of targets, directives and central control, aimed at raising standards in our public services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They mean well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the unintended consequence is to make these services less responsive to the people who use them, dashing expectations not meeting them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So our response, based on our philosophy of social responsibility, is to say to our nurses, doctors, teachers:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes you should meet higher standards, yes you should give your patients and your pupils more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re not going to tell you how to do it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are professionals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We trust in your vocation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So in a Conservative Britain, professional responsibility will provide the answer to rising expectations in the NHS and schools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>POVERTY AND REGENERATION</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And just as people will no longer accept second best in public services, we know that in their communities they are fed up with squalor and poverty and crime&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;and they look to their leaders to sort things out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Labour&rsquo;s response has been a massive expansion of central government into local communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The centralised Neighbourhood Renewal Unit, the insensitive Pathfinder programme, prescriptive top-down schemes for regeneration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can see why Labour have done it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the unintended consequence is to stifle the very spirit of community self-improvement that they are responding to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our response, based on our philosophy of social responsibility, is to trust local leaders, not undermine them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So we will hand power and control to local councils and local people who have the solutions to poverty, to crime, to urban decay in their hands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We trust in your knowledge and commitment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So in a Conservative Britain, civic responsibility will provide the answer to improving the quality of life in the communities left behind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CHILDREN</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then perhaps the greatest challenge of all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The challenge of bringing up children in a world that often seems fraught with risk and danger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is nothing that matters more to me than the safety and happiness of my family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course it&rsquo;s right that government should be on parents&rsquo; side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Labour take it way too far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A national database of every child.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Making childcare a state monopoly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slapping ASBOs on children who haven&rsquo;t even been born.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Labour&rsquo;s intentions may be good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the unintended consequence is to create a culture of irresponsibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They may have abandoned Clause 4 and the nationalisation of industry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But they are replacing it with the nationalisation of everyday life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The state can never be everywhere, policing the interactions of our daily lives - and it shouldn&rsquo;t try.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Real change will take years of patient hard work, and we will test every policy by asking: does it enhance parental responsibility?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need to understand that cultural change is worth any number of government initiatives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who has done more to improve school food, Jamie Oliver, or the Department of Education?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Put another way, we need more of Supernanny, less of the nanny state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So in a Conservative Britain, personal responsibility will provide the best answer to the risks and dangers of the modern world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personal responsibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Professional responsibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Corporate responsibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Civic responsibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the four pillars of our social responsibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is the Britain we want to build.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Britain that is more green.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More family-friendly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More local control over the things that matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Less arrogant about politicians&rsquo; ability to do it all on their own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But more optimistic about what we can achieve if we all work together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want an opportunity society, not an overpowering state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BUILDING OUR HOUSE</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This week, in our debates, we will lay the foundations of the house we are building together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The foundations must come first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How superficial, how insubstantial it would be, for us to make up policies to meet the pressures of the moment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Policy without principle is like a house without foundations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will not stand the test of time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is what our Policy Review is all about: getting it right for the long term.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OPTIMISM ABOUT BRITAIN&rsquo;S FUTURE</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we do this, we can help achieve so much for this country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a few years&rsquo; time, Britain could wake up to a bright new morning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have everything to be optimistic about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could not design a country with better natural advantages than we have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We speak the language of the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have links of history and culture with every continent on earth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have institutions &ndash; our legal system, our armed forces, the BBC, our great universities &ndash; which set the standard that all other countries measure themselves by.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our artists, writers and musicians inspire people the world over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are inventive, creative, irreverent and daring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this young century, these old advantages give us the edge we need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What a prospect for a great Party &ndash; to guide our nation at this time of opportunity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So let us stick to the plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us build - carefully, thoughtfully and patiently, a new house together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Preparing the ground as we move to the centre, meeting the priorities of the modern world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Laying the foundations with our idea - social responsibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And building on those foundations with the right policies for our long-term future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The nation&rsquo;s hopes are in our hands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People&rsquo;s hopes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your hopes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My hopes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In eight days&rsquo; time I will be forty years old.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have so much to look forward to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My young family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They have so much to look forward to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The world I want for them is the world I want for every family and every community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to know what I&rsquo;m all about, I can explain it one word.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That word is optimism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am optimistic about human nature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I will trust people to do the right thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Labour are pessimists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They think that without their guidance, people will do the wrong thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they want to regulate and control.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So let us show clearly which side we are on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let optimism beat pessimism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let sunshine win the day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And let everyone know that the Conservative Party is ready.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ready to serve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ready to fight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ready to win.</p></div>              </div>
