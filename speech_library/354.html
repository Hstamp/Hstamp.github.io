<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Helping young people buy their own home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Getting the long-term unemployed back to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Freezing fuel duty.</p>

<p>Cutting the deficit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Creating jobs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Creating wealth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make no mistake: it is this Party with the verve, energy and ideas to take our country forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I want to thank everyone here for the great week we've had.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we came to office, we faced a clear and daunting task: to turn our country around.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In May 2010, the needle on the gauge was at crisis point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People were talking about this country in a way they had not done for decades.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But three and a half years later, we are beginning to turn the corner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The deficit is falling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our economy is growing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The numbers of our fellow countrymen and women in work are rising.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are not there yet, not by a long way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, my friends, we are on our way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to thank the people who have done the most to get us this far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You. The British people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Never giving up. Working those extra hours. Coping with those necessary cuts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You. British business. You kept people on in the hard times. Invested before you knew for certain that things were getting better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Together - we are clearing up the mess that Labour left.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I have a simple question, to the people in this hall and beyond it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is that enough?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it enough that we just clear up Labour's mess and think 'job done'?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it enough to just fix what went wrong?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I say - no. Not for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This isn't job done; it is job begun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't come into politics just to fix what went wrong, but to build something right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We in this party - we don't dream of deficits and decimal points and dry fiscal plans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our dreams are about helping people get on in life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aspiration, opportunity: these are our words, our dreams.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So today I want to talk about our one, abiding mission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe it is the great Conservative mission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That as our economy starts to recover, we build a land of opportunity in our country today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I know, it'll be tough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I know we've got what it takes in this Party.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some people say "can't be done" - Conservatives say "what's to stop us?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They said we couldn't get terrorists out of our own country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well - Theresa knew otherwise...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...and that's why Abu Qatada had his very own May Day this year...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Didn't it feel good seeing him get on that plane?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some people said the NHS wasn't safe in our hands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well - we knew otherwise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who protected spending on the NHS? Not Labour - us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who started the Cancer Drugs Fund? Not Labour - us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And by the way - who presided over Mid Staffs?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Patients left for so long without water, they were drinking out of dirty vases...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...people's grandparents lying filthy and unwashed for days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who allowed that to happen? Yes, it was Labour...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...and don't you dare lecture anyone on the NHS again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And some people say a lot of things on Europe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You'll never be able to veto an EU treaty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You'll never cut the Budget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you did these things - you'd have no allies in Europe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well we've proved them wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I vetoed that treaty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got Britain out of the EU bail-out scheme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yes - I cut that budget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in doing all this, we haven't lost respect - we've won allies to get powers back from Europe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is what we will do...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...and at the end of it - yes - we will give the British people their say in a referendum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is our pledge. It will be your choice: in or out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BRITAIN IN THE WORLD</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And friends, you know what someone said about us recently?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apparently some Russian official said: Britain is "just a small island that no-one pays any attention to."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me just get this off my chest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the world wanted rights, who wrote Magna Carta?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When they wanted representation, who built the first Parliament?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When they looked for compassion, who led the abolition of slavery?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When they searched for equality, who gave women the vote?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When their freedom was in peril, who offered blood, toil, tears and sweat?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And today - whose music do they dance to?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whose universities do they flock to?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whose football league do they watch?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whose example of tolerance of people living together from every nation, every religion, young and old, straight and gay?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whose example do they aspire to?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I haven't even got on to the fact that this small island beat Russia in the Olympics last year, or that the biggest-selling vodka brand in the world isn't Russian, it's British - Smirnoff - made in Fife.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...so yes, we may be a small island</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>but I tell you what, we're a great country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I want to make a serious point about our place in the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following that vote on Syria in the House of Commons, some people said it was time for Britain to re-think our role.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sorry - but I don't agree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we shrunk from the world we would be less safe and less prosperous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The role we play, the organisations we belong to...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>... and yes - the fact our defence budget remains the 4th largest in the world...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...all this is not about national vanity - it's about our national interest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When British citizens -our fathers, mothers, daughters- are in danger...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...whether that's in the deserts of Algeria or the city of Nairobi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>then combatting international terrorism - it matters to us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When five of the world's fastest growing economies are African,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>then trading with Africa - and yes helping Africa to develop with aid - that matters to us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And at the heart of all this work - the finest Foreign Secretary I could ask for: William Hague.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Around the world, we really do matter as a United Kingdom:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The date of the referendum has been set. The decision is for Scotland to make.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the arguments about our economy, jobs, currency - I believe they make an unanswerable case for the UK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But today I want a more simple message to go out to all the people of Scotland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From us here in this hall, from me, from this party, from this country, from England, Wales, Northern Ireland</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and it's this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want you to stay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to stick together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think of all we've achieved together - the things we can do together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The nations - as one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Kingdom - United.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For 12 years now, men and women from all parts of these islands have been serving their country in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next year, the last of our combat troops will be coming home...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...having trained up the Afghans to look after their own country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than a decade of war.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sacrifice beyond measure - from the finest and bravest armed forces in the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I want us to stand, to raise the roof in here, to show just how proud of those men and women we are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THATCHER</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We in this room are a team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And this year, we said goodbye to one of our team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Margaret Thatcher made our country stand tall again, at home and abroad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rescuing our economy. Giving power to our people. Spreading home ownership. Creating work. Winning the Cold War. Saving the Falklands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I asked her about her record once.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was sitting next to her at a dinner - and I was really nervous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As ever she was totally charming, she put me at ease...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...but after a while I said: "Margaret, if you had your time in Government again, is there anything you'd do differently?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And she turned to me and said: "You know, I think I did pretty well the first time around."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well we can all agree with that - and we can all agree on this...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...she was the greatest peace-time Prime Minister our country has ever had.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LABOUR'S MESS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Margaret Thatcher had an almighty mess to clear up when she came to office</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and so did we.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will never forget what we found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The biggest Budget deficit in our peace-time history.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The deepest recession since the Second World War.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it wasn't just the debt and deficit Labour left,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it was who got hurt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Millions coming here from overseas while millions of British people were left on welfare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The richest paying lower tax rates than their cleaners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unsustainable, debt-fuelled banks booming - while manufacturing withered away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The North falling further behind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Towns where a quarter of people lived on benefits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Schools where 8 out of 10 children didn't get five decent GCSEs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, they were famously "intensely relaxed" about people getting filthy rich.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...but tragically, they were also "intensely relaxed" about people staying stuck on welfare year after year...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"intensely relaxed" about children leaving school without proper qualifications so they couldn't hope to get a job at the end of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That was it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That was what they left.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The casino economy meets the welfare society meets the broken education system...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a country for the few built by the so-called party of the many.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and Labour: we will never let you forget it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OUR MISSION</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These past few years have been a real struggle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But what people want to know now is: was the struggle worth it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And here's the honest answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The struggle will only be worth it if we as a country finish the job we've started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finishing the job means understanding this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our economy may be turning the corner - and of course that's great.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we still haven't finished paying for Labour's Debt Crisis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone thinks that's over, done, dealt with - they're living in a fantasy land.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This country's debt crisis, created by Labour, is not over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After three years of cuts, we still have one of the biggest deficits in the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are still spending more than we earn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We still need to earn more and yes, our Government still needs to spend less.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see that Labour have stopped talking about the debt crisis and now they talk about the cost of living crisis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As if one wasn't directly related to the other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to know what happens if you don't deal with a debt crisis..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...and how it affects the cost of living...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...just go and ask the Greeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So finishing the job means sticking to our course until we've paid off all of Labour's deficit, not just some of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yes - let's run a surplus so that this time we fix the roof when the sun is shining...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...as George said in that brilliant speech on Monday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To abandon deficit reduction now would throw away all the progress we've made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would put us back to square one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unbelievably, that's exactly what Labour now want to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How did they get us into this mess?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Too much spending, too much borrowing, too much debt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And what did they propose last week?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More spending, more borrowing, more debt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They have learned nothing - literally nothing - from the crisis they created.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But finishing the job is about more than clearing up the mess we were left.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It means building something better in its place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In place of the casino economy, one where people who work hard can actually get on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In place of the welfare society, one where no individual is written off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In place of the broken education system, one that gives every child the chance to rise up and succeed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our economy, our society, welfare, schools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...all reformed, all rebuilt - with one aim, one mission in mind:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make this country, at long last and for the first time ever, a land of opportunity for all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So it makes no difference whether you live in the North or in the South, whether you're black or you're white, a man or a woman, the school you went to, the background you have, who your parents were.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...what matters is the effort you put in, and if you put the effort in you'll have the chance to make it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's what the land of opportunity means.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's what finishing the job means.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course I know that others in politics may talk about these things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But wishing for something, caring about something - that's not enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can't conjure up a dynamic economy, a strong society, fantastic schools all with the stroke of a minister's pen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It takes a mixture of hard work, common sense and - above all - the right values.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the left say: you can't expect too much from the poorest kids; don't ask too much from people on welfare; business is the problem, not the solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here in this party we say: that's just wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you expect nothing of people that does nothing for them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, you must help people - but you help people by putting up ladders that they can climb through their own efforts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You don't help children succeed by dumbing down education.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...you help them by pushing them hard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good education is not about equality of outcomes but bringing the best out of every single child.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You don't help people by leaving them stuck on welfare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...but by helping them stand on their own two feet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why? Because the best way out of poverty is work - and the dignity that brings</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know that profit, wealth creation, tax cuts, enterprise...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...these are not dirty, elitist words - they're not the problem...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...they really are the solution because it's not government that creates jobs, it's businesses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it's businesses that get wages in people's pockets, food on their tables, hope for their families and success for our country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no shortcut to a land of opportunity.  No quick fix.  No easy way to do it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You build it business by business, school by school, person by person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...patiently, practically, painstakingly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And underpinning it all is that deep, instinctive belief that if you trust people and give them the tools, they will succeed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This party at its heart is about big people, strong communities, responsible businesses, a bigger society - not a bigger state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's how we've been clearing up the mess.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it's how we're going to build something better in its place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So let's stick with it and finish the job we've started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ECONOMY</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A land of opportunity starts in our economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The chance to get a decent job. To start a business. To own a home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And at the end of it all - more money in your pocket.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get decent jobs for people, you've got to recognise some fundamental economic facts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are in a global race today. No one owes us a living.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last week, our ambition to compete in the global race was airily dismissed as a race to the bottom...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...that it means competing with China on sweatshops and India on low wages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No - those countries are becoming our customers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and we've got to compete with California on innovation; Germany on high-end manufacturing; Asia on finance and technology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And here's something else you need to recognise about this race.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The plain fact is this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All those global companies that employ lots of people - they can set up anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They could go to Silicon Valley. To Berlin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yes, here in Manchester.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And these companies base their decisions on some simple things: like the tax rates in each country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if those taxes are higher here than elsewhere, they don't come here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if they don't come here, we don't get those jobs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you get that, Labour?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>British people don't get those jobs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last week Labour proposed to put up corporation tax on our biggest and most successful employers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is just about the most damaging, nonsensical, twisted economic policy you could possibly come up with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get to visit some amazing factories in my job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of my favourites is Jaguar Land Rover...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...not just because they actually let me get in a car and drive it around on my own...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...but really because I get to meet people there who are incredibly proud of their work and their craftsmanship...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...the fact that what they're making sells around the world - the best of British design and engineering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So when Ed Miliband talks about the face of big business, I think about the faces of these hardworking people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Labour is saying to their employers: "we want to put up your taxes. don't come here - stick your jobs and take them elsewhere".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that bashing business might play to a Labour audience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it's crazy for our country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if Labour's plan for jobs is to attack business - ours is to back business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regulation - down. Taxes - cut for businesses large and small. A new industrial policy that looks to the future - green jobs, aerospace jobs, life science jobs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We've made a good start: 1.4 million new jobs created in our private sector since we came to office...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...and that is 1.4 million reasons to finish the job we've started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a land of opportunity, it's easier to start your own business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To all those people who strike out on their own, who sit there night after night...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...checking and double checking whether the numbers stack up...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...I say I have so much respect for you - you are national heroes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll never forget watching Samantha do just that - winning her first customer, sorting out the cash flow, that magic moment when she got her first business cards printed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was incredibly proud of her then - and I am incredibly proud of her now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People setting up new businesses need finance - that's why we've brought in Start-up Loans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They need their taxes cut - and we're doing it - up to &pound;2000 off your National Insurance bill for every small business</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it's working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me tell you how many businesses have started up in Britain since the election: over 300,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is 300,000 more reasons to finish the job we've started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a land of opportunity, more people must be able to own a home of their own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You know that old saying, your home is your castle?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well for most young people today, their home is their landlord's.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generation Y is starting to become Generation Why Do We Bother?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Millions of them stuck renting when they're desperate to buy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I met a couple on Sunday - Emily and James.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They'd both had decent jobs, but because they didn't have rich parents, they couldn't get a big enough deposit to buy a house.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And let me tell you where I met them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In their new home, bought with our Help to Buy mortgage scheme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was still half built. but they showed me where the kitchen would be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outside there was rubble all over the ground, but they'd already bought a lawn-mower.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And they talked about how excited they were to be spending a first Christmas in a home of their own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is what we're about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And this, the party of aspiration is going to finish the job we've started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a land of opportunity there's another thing people need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the most important thing of all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>more money in their pockets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These have been difficult years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People have found it hard to make ends meet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's why we've frozen council tax.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and why we are freezing fuel duty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we need to do more. I know that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We've heard Labour's ideas to help with the cost of living.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taxes on banks they want to spend ten times over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Promising free childcare - then saying that actually, you've got to pay for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An energy promise they admitted 24 hours later they might not be able to keep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's all sticking plasters and quick fixes... cobbled together for the TV cameras.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Red Ed and his Blue Peter economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To raise living standards in the long-term, you need to do some major things:...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...you need to cut the deficit to keep mortgage rates low...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...you need to grow your economy, get people jobs...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...and yes - cut people's taxes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want people to keep more of their money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We've already cut the taxes of 25 million hardworking people...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...and yes - that is 25 million more reasons to finish the job we've started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're Tories. We believe in low taxes. And believe me - we will keep on cutting the taxes of hardworking people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NORTH SOUTH</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And here in Manchester let me say this: when I say a land of opportunity for all I mean everyone - North and South.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This country has been too London-centric for far too long.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's why we need a new North-South railway line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact is this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The West Coast mainline is almost full.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have to build a new railway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and the choice is between  another old-style Victorian one - or a high speed one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just imagine if someone had said, no, we can't build the M1, or the Severn Bridge, imagine how that would be hobbling our economy today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HS2 is about bringing North and South together in our national endeavour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because think of what more we could do with the pistons firing in all parts of our country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With its wind and wave power, let's make the Humber the centre of clean energy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With its resources under the ground, let's make Blackpool the centre of Europe for the shale gas industry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With its brains and research centres, let's make Manchester the world leader in advanced materials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're building an economy for the North and South, embracing new technologies, producing things and selling them to the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So make no mistake who's looking forward in British politics...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...we'll leave the 1970s-style socialism to others...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...we are the party of the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're making progress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You know how I know that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's every week, at Prime Minister's Questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was a time when I'd look across to Ed Balls, and there he was, shouting his head off, and doing this with his hands - screaming out the economy was flat-lining.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...and all with such glee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But recently, it's gone a bit quiet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could it be because there was no double dip and the economy's now growing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, I've got a gesture of my own for Ed Balls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...and don't worry - it's not a rude one...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.jobs are up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.construction is up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...manufacturing is up...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.inward investment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.retail sales.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.homebuilding...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.business confidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.consumer confidence - all these things are up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And to anyone who wants to talk our economy down, let me tell you this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since this conference began, over 100,000 jet planes have soared into the sky on wings made in Britain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every single day in this country, over 4,000 cars are coming off the production line - ready to be exported around the globe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year, Britain overtook France as Germany's top trading partner...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...not bad for a nation of shop-keepers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that's the point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exports to China are up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exports to Brazil are up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.exports to India, Russia, Thailand, South Korea, Australia - all up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So let us never forget the cast-iron law of British politics...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes - the oceans can rise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.and empires can fall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.but one thing will never, ever change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.it's Labour who wreck our economy and it's we Conservatives who clear it up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDUCATION</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A land of opportunity means educating our children - and I mean all our children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's OK for the children who have parents reading them stories every night - and that's great.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.but what about the ones at the back of the class, in the chaotic home, in the home of the drug addict or alcoholic?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need these children - and frankly they need us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's why three and a half years ago, one man came into the Department of Education.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...Michael Gove, there he is...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...with a belief in excellence and massive energy...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...like a cross between Mr Chips and the Duracell bunny.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's look at the results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More students studying proper science.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More children learning a foreign language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We've ended the dumbing down in exams.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the first time - children in our schools will learn the new language of computer coding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And we're sending a clear message to children: if you fail English and maths GCSE, you're going to have to take and re-take them again until you pass.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because as I tell my own children - there's not a job in the world where you don't need to spell and add up properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But ultimately - really raising standards means innovation, choice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.it means giving passionate people the freedom to run our schools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's what Free Schools are all about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll never forget sitting in the classroom at Perry Beeches III in Birmingham, on the first day of term this year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I met a mum there who said to me - this is what I've dreamed of for my child...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...proper uniforms, high standards...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...this is going to give my child a good start in life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Michael Howard asked me what job I wanted in the Shadow cabinet I said education...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...because this is the kind of thing I came into politics to bring about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You want to know something totally extraordinary about free schools?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Labour's official policy is to be against them...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...but - get this - Labour MPs are backing them in their local area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And not just any Labour MPs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I promise I'm not making this up..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...the Shadow Education Secretary - Stephen Twigg - has backed one in his own city.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unbelievable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And isn't that always the way with the Left?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They don't like privilege - unless of course it's for their own children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well we in this Party are ambitious for all our children...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...and we've got to finish the job we started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We've already got technical colleges run by great companies like JCB...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...I say: let's have one of those colleges in every single major town.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We've had a million apprenticeships start with this Government...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...now we want a new expectation: as you leave school you have a choice - go to university or do an apprenticeship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And while we've still got children leaving primary school not reading, writing and adding up properly...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...let us set this ambition for our country: let's eliminate illiteracy and give every one of those children a chance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And friends as we do all this, we're remembering the most vulnerable children of all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are thousands of children every year who grow up in homes where nappies - and bedclothes - go unchanged...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...and where their cries of pain go unheard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These children just need the most basic opportunity of all: a loving family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two years ago I told you about our determination to speed up adoption...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...and this past year, we saw record numbers finding permanent, loving homes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4000 children adopted...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...that is 4000 more reasons to finish the job we've started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And as we keep on with this, we remember who is on the front line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have to make some tough decisions in my job...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...but none as tough as whether to break up a family and rescue a child... or try and stitch that family back together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Social work is a noble and vital calling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll never forget how after my son Ivan was born, a social worker sat patiently in our kitchen and told us about the sort of help we might need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Government has helped get some of the brightest graduates into teaching...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...and we have pledged to do the same for social work...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...now let us, in this hall, hear it for Britain's social workers who are doing such an important job in our country today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WELFARE</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The land of opportunity needs one final thing: welfare that works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know how badly things went wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our fellow citizens working every hour of every day to put food on the table ask this: why should my taxes go to people who could work but don't?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or to those who live in homes that hardworking people could never afford?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or to people who have no right to be here in the first place?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I say this to the British people: you have every right to be angry about a system that is unfair and unjust - and that's why we are sorting it out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We've capped welfare.  We've capped housing benefit.  We've insisted on new rules so that if you reject work, you lose benefits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And let's be absolutely clear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Boris said in that great speech yesterday, the problems in our welfare system and the problems in our immigration system are inextricably linked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we don't get our people back to work - we shouldn't be surprised if millions want to come here to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we must act on immigration directly too - and we are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Capping immigration. Clamping down on the bogus colleges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And when the Immigration Bill comes before Parliament, we will make sure some simple and fair things, that should have always been the case, are now set in stone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are not entitled to our free National Health Service, you should pay for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have no right to be here, you cannot rent a flat or a house.  Not off the council, not off anyone else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you are a foreign prisoner fighting deportation, you should pay your own legal bills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you appeal - you must do it from your own country, after you've been deported, not from here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And on these huge, national problems we are making progress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Immigration has come down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On welfare: not only are there more people in work than ever before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.the number of households where no one works is at its lowest rate since records began.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.and I want to thank the most determined champion for social justice this Party has ever had: Iain Duncan Smith.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Iain understands that this isn't about fixing systems, it's about saving lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.and that's why we've got to finish the job we've started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are still over a million young people not in education, employment, or training.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today it is still possible to leave school, sign on, find a flat, start claiming housing benefit and opt for a life on benefits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's time for bold action here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We should ask, as we write our next manifesto, if that option should really exist at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead we should give young people a clear, positive choice:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to school. Go to college. Do an apprenticeship. Get a job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But just choose the dole? We've got to offer them something better than that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And let no one paint ideas like this as callous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think about it: with your children, would you dream of just leaving them to their own devices, not getting a job, not training, nothing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No - you'd nag and push and guide and do anything to get them on their way. and so must we.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So this is what we want to see: everyone under 25 - earning or learning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And you know - on this, as on everything else, Labour will fight us...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.but remember: we are giving people real opportunities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've had people say to me "I'm back on my feet"... "I feel worthwhile."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One wrote to me saying: now I can tell my son his Dad really does something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is what our Party is all about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We don't patronise people, put a benefit cheque in their hand and pat them on the head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look people in the eye as equals and say: yes, you've been down - but you're not out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.you can do it, you have it in you, we will give you that chance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that's why we can say today that it's this Party that is fighting for all those who were written off by Labour...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.it's this Party that's for the many not the few.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.Yes - the land of despair was Labour...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.but the land of hope is Tory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have done some big things to transform Britain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we need to finish the job we've started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need to go further, do more for hardworking people...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...give more children a chance, back more businesses, help create more jobs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I'm clear about how that job will best get done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It requires a strong Government, with a clear mandate, that is accountable for what it promises and yes, what it delivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And let me tell everyone here what that means.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the election comes, we won't be campaigning for a coalition...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...we will be fighting heart and soul for a majority Conservative Government - because that is what our country needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You don't do this job to be popular.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You do it because you love your country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do the best I can. And for me, it comes back to some simple things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Country first. Do what's decent. Think long-term.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's an old story that's told about a great hall in Oxford, near my constituency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For hundreds of years it's stood there - held up with vast oak beams.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the 19th century, those beams needed replacing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And you know what they found?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>500 years before, someone had thought. those beams will need replacing one day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.so they planted some oak trees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just think about that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Centuries had passed. Columbus had reached America. Gravity had been discovered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.and when those oaks were needed, they were ready.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Margaret Thatcher once said: "We are in the business of planting trees for our children and grandchildren or we have no business being in politics at all."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is what we are doing today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not just making do and mending.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.but making something better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I got to my feet, almost a hundred children have been born across this country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Children of wealth - and children of none.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Children of parents in work - and children of parents out of work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For every single one of those new-born babies let us pledge today that we will build something better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.a land of opportunity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A country built on that enduring principle, seared in our hearts, that if you work hard, save, play by the rules and do your fair share - then nothing should stand in your way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A new economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A new welfare system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A new set of values in our schools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not just fixing the mess we inherited - but building something better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We've got a year and a half 'til that election...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.a year and a half until Britain makes a choice: move forward to something better or go back to something worse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.but I believe that if this party fights with all we have, then this country will make the right choice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because we always have before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever we've had the choice of giving in to some shabby compromise or pushing forward to something better we've said: this is Great Britain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.the improbable hero of history.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.the country that doesn't give in, that doesn't give up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.that knows there's no such thing as destiny - only our determination to succeed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I look to our future and I'm confident.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are battles to fight but beyond this hall are the millions of hardworking people who renew the great in Great Britain every day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the way they work and the way they give and raise their families.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the people we have alongside us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...together we've made it this far...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...together we'll finish the job we've started...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...together we'll build that land of opportunity.</p></div>              </div>
