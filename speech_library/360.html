<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;and not just any government &ndash; a majority Conservative Government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To the people in this hall, I want to say thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are the greatest team a Prime Minister could ever have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And to the British people:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you put your cross in the Conservative box, you were putting your faith in us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To finish the job we started. To back working people. To deliver security for you and your family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you now: we will not let you down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But just for a moment, think back to May 7th.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but it only takes two words to make me smile. Exit poll.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then what happened that night:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Conservatives, winning across Wales; on the march in the Midlands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bolton West, Derby North, Berwick, Wells &ndash; Conservative once more&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;Gower for the first time ever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The North, more Tory; the South, the East, almost a clean sweep&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;and Cornwall &ndash; that wonderful county &ndash; 100 per cent Conservative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As dawn rose, a new light &ndash; a bluer light &ndash; fell across our isles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I will never forget that morning. Getting back to London. Seeing many of you. Then sitting down in the flat at No10 with Sam and the kids getting ready for school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There we were, surrounded by half-packed boxes and bin bags. Well, you have to be ready for anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was writing my speech and preparing to go and see Her Majesty. And I thought&hellip; I&rsquo;ll just lie down and let it all sink in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I shut my eyes, Ed Balls had gone. And when I woke up and I switched on the radio, Nigel Farage had gone too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was a brief moment when I thought it was all a dream.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a serious point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why did all the pollsters and the pundits get it so wrong?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because, fundamentally, they didn&rsquo;t understand the people who make up our country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The vast majority of people aren&rsquo;t obsessives, arguing at the extremes of the debate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me put it as simply as I can: Britain and Twitter are not the same thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The British people are decent, sensible, reasonable&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;and they just want a government that supports the vulnerable, backs those who do the right thing and helps them get on in life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good jobs; a decent home; better childcare; controlled immigration; lower taxes so there&rsquo;s more money at the end of the month&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;an NHS that&rsquo;s there for them, 7 days a week; great schools; dignity in retirement&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;that is what people want and that is what we will deliver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The party of working people, the party for working people &ndash; today, tomorrow, always.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PARTY CHANGE</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ten years ago, I stood on a stage just like this one and said if we changed our party we could change our country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done that &ndash; together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t campaign on the NHS alone &ndash; you joined me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t just me who put social justice, equality for gay people, tackling climate change, and helping the world&rsquo;s poorest at the centre of the Conservative Party&rsquo;s mission &ndash; we all did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I didn&rsquo;t select our candidates &ndash; it was you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look who was elected in May.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nusrat Ghani, whose parents, just a generation ago, were living in a small village in Kashmir.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seema Kennedy, who was five when she and her family were forced to flee revolutionary Iran.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Five years ago, Johnny Mercer was on his third tour of duty in Afghanistan. Caught in an ambush, he was left cradling a dear comrade as he lay fatally wounded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just days before the election, Scott Mann was doing his postal round in Cornwall &ndash; delivering not just his own campaign leaflets, but his rivals&rsquo; too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Different journeys, often difficult journeys, all leading here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So let us hear it for them now &ndash; the new generation of Conservative MPs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Round the cabinet table, a third of my colleagues are women.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few months ago, we were discussing childcare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was introduced by the Black British son of a single parent, Sam Gyimah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He was backed up by the daughter of Gujarati immigrants who arrived in our country from East Africa with nothing except the clothes they stood up in, Priti Patel&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;and the first speaker was Sajid Javid, whose father came here from Pakistan to drive the buses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is what we&rsquo;ve done together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now with couples married because of us&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;working people backed because of us&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;the NHS safe because of us&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;and children in the poorest parts of the world saved because of us&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;everyone in this hall can be incredibly proud of our journey &ndash; the journey of the modern, compassionate, One Nation Conservative Party.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GREATER BRITAIN</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So as five years of government stretch out before us, what do I see on the skyline?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love Britain. I love our history and what we&rsquo;ve given to the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love our get-up-and-go; that whenever we&rsquo;re down, we&rsquo;re never out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love our character; our decency; our sense of humour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I love every part of our country. England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland &ndash; we are one nation and I will defend our Union with everything I have got.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every day, in every way, Great Britain lives up to its name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I know this: we can make it greater still.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Greater Britain. Where people have greater hope, greater chances, greater security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really believe we&rsquo;re on the brink of something special in our country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year, we&rsquo;ve seen more people in work than at any time in our history&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;more of our children starting university than ever before&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;more British entrepreneurs setting up shop than anywhere else in Europe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wages are rising. Hope is returning. We&rsquo;re moving into the light.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re not there yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re only half way through.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me, that has a very literal meaning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can say something today that perhaps no Prime Minister has ever really been able to say before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting the second half of my time in this job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you know, I am not going to fight another election as your leader. So I don&rsquo;t have the luxury of unlimited time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me tell you: I am in just as much of a hurry as five years ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Securing our country, growing our economy; jobs, exports, growth, infrastructure&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;these are the stepping stones on the path to greatness for our country &ndash; and we&rsquo;ve been laying them every day since we came to office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will continue to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But to make Britain greater, we need to tackle some deep social problems&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;problems we only just made a start on, as we focused on the economic emergency that faced us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scourge of poverty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The brick wall of blocked opportunity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The shadow of extremism &ndash; hanging over every single one of us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Greater Britain doesn&rsquo;t just need a stronger economy &ndash; it needs a stronger society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And delivering this social reform is entirely fitting with the great history of the Conservative Party&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;who have always been the optimists, the agents of hope and the leaders of change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I joined it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I wanted to lead it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now, in my final term as Prime Minister, I say: let&rsquo;s live up to the greatest traditions of Conservative social reform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CONSERVATIVE VALUES</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all the challenges we face, we will be guided by our Conservative values.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our belief in strong defence and sound money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our belief in an enterprise economy&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;that if you set free the ambition that burns so deeply within the British people, they will strike out on their own, take on new workers, take on the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our belief in equality of opportunity, as opposed to equality of outcome&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;not everyone ending up with the same exam results, the same salary, the same house &ndash; but everyone having the same shot at them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now some people may argue these things are obvious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have to tell you, they&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It becomes clearer by the day that the Labour Party has completely abandoned any notion of these ideas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So let us resolve here, at this conference, to do what we&rsquo;ve always done: to prove our Conservative truths&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;to save Britain from the danger of Labour&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;and to rebuild Britain so it is greater still.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Greater Britain &ndash; that is our goal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NATIONAL SECURITY</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It begins by making the case for strong defence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My first duty as Prime Minister is to keep people safe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the loneliest moments in this job are when you are reading intelligence reports about plots being planned against the British people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This summer I was told that Reyaad Khan and Junaid Hussain were in Syria planning terrorist attacks on UK soil.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, I asked all the proper questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do we stop them? Is there another way? Do we have that capability? Is it legal?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I knew that whatever action I took would provoke a big debate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But my job as Prime Minister is quite simple, really: ultimately, it&rsquo;s not to debate; it&rsquo;s to decide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the choice I faced was this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Act &ndash; and we could stop them carrying out their plans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stall &ndash; and we could see innocent people murdered on our streets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I took decisive action to keep Britain safe &ndash; and that&rsquo;s what I will always do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LABOUR LEADER</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And on the subject of protecting our country from terrorism, let me just say this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thousands of words have been written about the new Labour leader.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But you only really need to know one thing: he thinks the death of Osama bin Laden was a &ldquo;tragedy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A tragedy is nearly 3,000 people murdered one morning in New York.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A tragedy is the mums and dads who never came home from work that day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A tragedy is people jumping from the towers after the planes hit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My friends &ndash; we cannot let that man inflict his security-threatening, terrorist-sympathising, Britain-hating ideology on the country we love.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MIGRATION</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another big judgment call to make is when a refugee crisis confronts our world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like most people, I found it impossible to get the image of that poor Syrian boy Aylan Kurdi out of my mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know in our hearts our responsibilities to help those fleeing for their lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we know, too, that we must keep our heads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a simple fact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Twelve million people have been made homeless by the conflict in Syria. And so far only 4 per cent of them have come to Europe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we opened the door to every refugee, our country would be overwhelmed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best thing Britain can do is help neighbouring countries, the Syrian people and the refugees in the camps &hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;and when we do take refugees, to take them from the region, rather than acting in a way that encourages more to make that dangerous journey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we do this, let&rsquo;s remember: we haven&rsquo;t only just started caring about Syrians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been helping them over the past four years, giving more in aid to that part of the world than any other country except America.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And we have been able to do that because this party made a promise and kept a promise &ndash; to spend 0.7 per cent of our national income on aid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other countries also made that promise. But they didn&rsquo;t keep it.</p>
<p>I say to them: if Britain can keep her promises, so should you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the real answer to the refugee crisis lies in helping countries like Syria become places where people actually want to live.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That means having a government that&rsquo;s not terrorising its people &ndash; and that&rsquo;s why Assad must go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In its place, we need a government that can be our ally in the defeat of ISIL&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;because we will never be safe here in Britain until we eradicate that death cult.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some think we can contract that out to America. We shouldn&rsquo;t. We must play our part too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And we can, because of that commitment we made this summer: yes, we will spend two per cent of our GDP on defence &ndash; this year, next year, throughout this decade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the coming years, we&rsquo;ll be launching the biggest aircraft carriers in our history&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;a new class of Hunter Killer submarines&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;new Joint Strike Fighter jets; improved Apache helicopters; a new fleet of drones&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;and because our independent nuclear deterrent is our ultimate insurance policy &ndash; this Government will order four new trident submarines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In government, I have a team who keep us safe at home and abroad&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;Justine Greening, Michael Fallon, Philip Hammond and Theresa May.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But above all, we have Britain&rsquo;s Armed Forces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me tell you this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the last year alone they tackled Ebola in West Africa; protected the skies over the Baltic; flew missions over Iraq.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They built defences against ISIL in Lebanon; trained army officers in Afghanistan; and patrolled the seas around the Falklands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There they were, in the Pacific, flying supplies to cyclone victims; in the Atlantic, shipping assistance to those hit by hurricanes; in the Med, pulling people out of sinking dinghies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Little England? No. Never.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Great Britain. And I&rsquo;ll tell you what, with Armed Forces like this, we can be even greater still.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s stand and thank them for everything they do to keep us safe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EUROPE</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Greater Britain is one that is strong in the world &ndash; and that should mean one that is strong in Europe, too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It comes back to those Conservative values: our belief in the nation state, but also in free trade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We all know what&rsquo;s wrong with the EU &ndash; it&rsquo;s got too big, too bossy, too interfering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we also know what&rsquo;s right about it &ndash; it&rsquo;s the biggest single market in the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, some people say: &ldquo;take what we&rsquo;ve got and put up with it&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Others say: &ldquo;just walk away from the whole thing&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I say: no. This is Britain. We don&rsquo;t duck fights. We get stuck in. We fix problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how we kept our border checkpoints when others decided to take theirs down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how we kept the pound when others went head first into the Euro.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because we do things our way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We get rebates. We get out of bailouts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But do you know what? It&rsquo;s not just what we get out of, it&rsquo;s what we get Europe into.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who do you think got Europe to open trade talks with America, which would be the biggest trade deal in our history?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who do you think got Europe to agree to sanctions on Iran, which brought that country to the negotiating table?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Us. Britain. We did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Believe me, I have no romantic attachment to the European Union and its institutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m only interested in two things: Britain&rsquo;s prosperity and Britain&rsquo;s influence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m going to fight hard in this renegotiation &ndash; so we can get a better deal and the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me give you one example.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we joined the European Union we were told that it was about going into a common market, rather than the goal that some had for &ldquo;ever closer union&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me put this very clearly: Britain is not interested in &ldquo;ever closer union&rdquo; &ndash; and I will put that right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ECONOMIC SECURITY</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Greater Britain needs a dynamic economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, it&rsquo;s a beacon in an uncertain world&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;we&rsquo;ve got more foreign investment flooding into our country than anywhere else in Europe &ndash; anywhere in the world except for America and China.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if anyone thinks the battle on the economy is won, they need to think again. The battle has only just begun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We still need to find savings and produce more; still need to become more competitive; still need to make the most of our entire country &ndash; and build the Northern Powerhouse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And all at a time when our opponents have given up any sensible, reasonable, rational arguments on the economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We live in a country where the main opposition party &ndash; let&rsquo;s not forget, the alternative government &ndash; believes in nationalising industries without compensation, jacking up taxes to 60 per cent of people&rsquo;s income, and printing money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an academic called Richard Murphy. He&rsquo;s the Labour Party&rsquo;s new economics guru, and the man behind their plan to print more money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He gave an interview a few weeks ago. He was very frank. He admitted that Labour&rsquo;s plan would cause a &ldquo;sterling crisis&rdquo;, but to be fair&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;he did add, and I quote, that it &ldquo;would pass very quickly&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s alright then.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His book is actually called &ldquo;The Joy of Tax&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve read it. It&rsquo;s got 64 positions &ndash; and they&rsquo;re all wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is actually serious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tell you: our party&rsquo;s success in growing our economy and winning the economic arguments has never been more vital.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nothing less than the security of every single family in our country depends on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And as we do that, I know that we will have on our side not just the British people, not just British business&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;but our Iron Chancellor, George Osborne.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You know what makes me most angry about Labour?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just that their arguments are wrong; it&rsquo;s the self-righteous way they make them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The deficit-deniers, who go around saying we&rsquo;re hurting the poor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hang on a second.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who gets hurt when governments lose control of spending and interest rates go through the roof?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who gets hurt when you waste money on debt interest and have to cut the NHS?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who gets hurt when taxes go up and businesses start firing rather than hiring?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No &ndash; not the rich&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;it&rsquo;s poor people, working people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, the very people Labour claim to be for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well let&rsquo;s just remember: Labour ideas don&rsquo;t help the poor, they hurt the poor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, Labour: you&rsquo;re not for working people, but hurting people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want a lecture about poverty, ask Labour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want something done about it, come to us, the Conservatives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another argument we need to win.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are some people who understand the deficit needs to come down, but don&rsquo;t get why we need a surplus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you why.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t stand here like a former Prime Minister once did and say I have abolished boom and bust.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t just be thinking about today, we should be thinking about the rainy days that could come &ndash; just like a family does.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They put something aside, take out the insurance plan, pay off some of the mortgage when they have something spare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we should do as a country &ndash; making sure we are ready to cope with future crises.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a word for those who say live for today, forget about tomorrow: it&rsquo;s selfish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not here to mortgage our children&rsquo;s future. I&rsquo;m here to insure it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HOME OWNERSHIP</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But for me, there&rsquo;s one big piece of unfinished business in our economy: housing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Greater Britain must mean more families owning a home of their own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It goes back to those Conservative beliefs: reward for hard work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve worked hard and saved, I don&rsquo;t want you just to have a roof over your head &ndash; I want you to have a roof of your own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the last 5 years, 600,000 new homes have been built.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than 150 people a day are moving in thanks to our Help to Buy scheme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in our manifesto, we announced a breakthrough policy: extending the Right to Buy to housing association tenants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some people said this would be impossible. Housing associations would never stand for it. The legislation would never pass.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me tell you something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Greg Clark, our brilliant Communities Secretary, has secured a deal with housing associations to give their tenants the Right to Buy their home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That will mean the first tenants can start to buy their homes from next year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, as we said in our manifesto, 1.3 million to be given the chance to become homeowners. A promise made. A promise kept.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the challenge is far, far bigger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a generation of hardworking men and women in their 20s and 30s are waking up each morning in their childhood bedrooms &ndash; that should be a wakeup call for us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need a national crusade to get homes built.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That means banks lending, government releasing land, and yes &ndash; planning being reformed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in all these things I&rsquo;ll be working with a great London Mayoral candidate &ndash; and, I hope, soon to be our London Mayor &ndash; Zac Goldsmith.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I want to single someone out. He&rsquo;s served this country. He&rsquo;s served this party. And there&rsquo;s a huge amount more to come.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s hear it for the man who for two terms has been Mayor of the greatest capital city on earth: Boris Johnson.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Increasing home ownership means something else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For years, politicians have been talking about building what they call &ldquo;affordable homes&rdquo; &ndash; but the phrase was deceptive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It basically meant homes that were only available to rent. What people want are homes they can actually own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After all, the officials who prepare the plans for the new homes, the developers who build them, the politicians who talk about them&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;most of these people own the homes they live in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t they realise other people want what they&rsquo;ve got &ndash; a home of their own?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So today, I can announce a dramatic shift in housing policy in our country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those old rules which said to developers: you can build on this site, but only if you build affordable homes for rent&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;we&rsquo;re replacing them with new rules&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;you can build here, and those affordable homes can be available to buy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, from Generation Rent to Generation Buy&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;our party, the Conservative party&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;the party of home ownership in Britain today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SOCIAL REFORM</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A more prosperous Britain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we must not stop there as we build a Greater Britain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are not a one-trick party.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For us, economic success &ndash; that&rsquo;s not the finished article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the foundation on which we can build a better society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our patriotism has never been simply some grand notion of ruling the waves, or riding high in the money markets&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;but a deep compulsion which says: &ldquo;you make a country greater by making life better for its people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And today, that means entering those no-go zones, where politicians often don&rsquo;t dare to venture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It means taking on our big social problems&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;entrenched poverty, blocked opportunity, the extremism that blights our communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So when the new mum looks at her new-born baby &ndash; the most precious thing she&rsquo;s ever seen &ndash; and she vows to provide for it, she knows she actually can.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the schoolgirl sits in that classroom, she knows that her studies really can take her to the very top.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the child of immigrants sees our flag, he feels so loyal to this country &ndash; his country &ndash; he wants to put on a uniform and defend it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is what fires me up. Not pounds and pence, plans and policies, but people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And to those who say: our social problems are too big and there&rsquo;s no way you can sort them out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I say: You said our party wouldn&rsquo;t change &ndash; we have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You said our long-term economic plan wouldn&rsquo;t work &ndash; it is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You said we wouldn&rsquo;t win the election &ndash; we did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So we are going to tackle those big social problems &ndash; just you watch us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>POVERTY</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Central to that is an all-out assault on poverty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conservatives understand that if we&rsquo;re serious about solving the problem, we need to tackle the root causes of poverty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Homes where no-one works; children growing up in chaos; addiction, mental health problems, abuse, family breakdown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, a teenager sitting their GCSEs is more likely to own a smartphone than have a dad living with them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think of your own child, think of the day they were born; how fragile they were&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;and then think that, every day, three babies are born in Britain addicted to heroin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll never deal with poverty unless we get to grips with these issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We made a start in the last five years with our Troubled Families programme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already turned around the lives of over 100,000 families.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And do you know one of its central aims?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simple: get the adults a job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because we know in this party that the best route out of poverty is work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we reformed welfare, introduced the cap and helped create 2.5 million jobs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not enough simply to have a job: work has got to pay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nearly two-thirds of children in poverty have parents who are in jobs. For them, work hasn&rsquo;t worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve cut taxes for the lowest paid and we&rsquo;ll keep on doing that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And from next year, we&rsquo;ll take a giant leap forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, a new National Living Wage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over &pound;9 an hour by the end of the decade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An &pound;80-a-week pay rise for the lowest paid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Work paying for millions of people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So let the message go out: if you work hard, want to get on, want more money at the end of the month&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;the party for you is right here in this hall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But being out of work is only one of the causes we must tackle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Children in care are today almost guaranteed to live in poverty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>84 per cent leave school without five good GCSEs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>70 per cent of prostitutes were once in care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And tragically, care leavers are four times more likely to commit suicide than anyone else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These children are in our care; we, the state, are their parents &ndash; and what are we setting them up for&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;the dole, the streets, an early grave?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tell you: this shames our country and we will put it right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as we said to failing schools, &ldquo;do a better job with our children or we will send new leaders in&rdquo;, so we will say to poorly performing social services, &ldquo;improve or be taken over&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as we got the best graduates teaching at our most difficult schools, let&rsquo;s get our brightest and best to the frontline of social work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we must also stop children needing to be in care at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we came to office, the adoption rate in our country was frankly a scandal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has gone up. Our Adoption Bill will help it increase still further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s so much more to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So let us in this hall say to all those children desperate for a family, and all those families yearning for a child:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We, the Conservatives, we are the ones who will bring you together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another service run by the state that all too often fails and entrenches poverty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prison.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I believe if you&rsquo;ve committed a crime, punishment must follow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And when it&rsquo;s serious enough, that punishment must mean prison.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not forget, since we came to office, crime is down by a quarter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the system is still not working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Half of criminals offend within a year of being released.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nearly half go into prison with no qualifications; many come out with none either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And all the problems that may have led them to that life &ndash; drug addiction, mental health problems, childhood abuse &ndash; remain unchanged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have got to get away from the sterile lock-em-up or let-em-out debate, and get smart about this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When prisoners are in jail, we have their full attention for months at a time &ndash; so let&rsquo;s treat their problems, educate them, put them to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we restrict someone&rsquo;s freedom outside prison, we can make sure they&rsquo;re working and paying taxes, rather than spending &pound;30,000 a year keeping them in a cell &ndash; so where it makes sense, let&rsquo;s use electronic tags to help keep us safe and help people go clean.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And when our prisons are relics from the time of Dickens &ndash; it&rsquo;s time to sell them off and build new ones that actually work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is going to be a big area of social reform in the next five years. And I have just the man for the job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The man who takes on every vested interest and gives everyone a chance&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;the man who began the great transformation of our education system and is now going to do the same for prisons&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;yes, the great Conservative reformer, Michael Gove.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OPPORTUNITY</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we tackle the causes of poverty, we can make our country greater.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s another big social problem we need to fix.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In politicians&rsquo; speak: a &ldquo;lack of social mobility&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In normal language: people unable to rise from the bottom to the top, or even from the middle to the top, because of their background.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Listen to this: Britain has the lowest social mobility in the developed world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here, the salary you earn is more linked to what your father got paid than in any other major country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, for us Conservatives, the party of aspiration, we cannot accept that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know that education is the springboard to opportunity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our reforms are already working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More children studying maths and science. More learning coding and engineering. More doing the extra-curricular activities that teach confidence and build character.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, I was at a school in Runcorn. Last year, 53 of their children went off to university. 52 of them were the first ever in their family to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is why I&rsquo;m so passionate about academies and free schools:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Head teachers are growing in confidence as they throw off the shackles of local council control&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;raising the aspirations of children, parents, communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This movement is sweeping across our country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So my next ambition is this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>500 new Free Schools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every school an academy&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;and yes &ndash; Local Authorities running schools a thing of the past.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s be honest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For too many people, even a good education isn&rsquo;t enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are other barriers that stand in their way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Picture this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve graduated with a good degree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You send out your CV far and wide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But you get rejection after rejection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s wrong? It&rsquo;s not the qualifications or the previous experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just two words at the top: first name, surname.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you know that in our country today: even if they have exactly the same qualifications, people with white-sounding names are nearly twice as likely to get call backs for jobs than people with ethnic-sounding names?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a true story.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One young black girl had to change her name to Elizabeth before she got any calls to interviews.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That, in 21st century Britain, is disgraceful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can talk all we want about opportunity, but it&rsquo;s meaningless unless people are really judged equally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think about it like this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Opportunity doesn&rsquo;t mean much to a British Muslim if he walks down the street and is abused for his faith.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Opportunity doesn&rsquo;t mean much to a black person constantly stopped and searched by the police because of the colour of their skin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Opportunity doesn&rsquo;t mean much to a gay person rejected for a job because of the person they love.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean much to a disabled person prevented from doing what they&rsquo;re good at because of who they are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a dad of two daughters &ndash; opportunity won&rsquo;t mean anything to them if they grow up in a country where they get paid less because of their gender rather than how good they are at their work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The point is this: you can&rsquo;t have true opportunity without real equality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I want our party to get this right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes us, the party of the fair chance; the party of the equal shot&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;the party that doesn&rsquo;t care where you come from, but only where you&rsquo;re going&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;us, the Conservatives, I want us to end discrimination and finish the fight for real equality in our country today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EXTREMISM</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tackling the causes of poverty. Fighting for real opportunity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s one more big social reform in our mission to rebuild Britain as an even greater country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need to confront &ndash; and I mean really confront &ndash; extremism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I read what some young people born and brought up in this country are doing, it makes me feel sick to my stomach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Girls not much older than my eldest daughter, swapping loving family homes and straight-A futures for a life of servitude under ISIL, in a land of violence and oppression.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boys who could do anything they wanted in Britain &ndash; who have benefitted from all this country stands for &ndash; instead ending up in the desert wielding a knife.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This ideology, this diseased view of the world, has become an epidemic &ndash; infecting minds from the mosques of Mogadishu to the bedrooms of Birmingham.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s what we need to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One: tear up the narrative that says Muslims are persecuted and the West deserves what it gets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Never mind that it&rsquo;s Britain and America behind the biggest effort to help the victims of Syria.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who is ISIL murdering more than anyone else? Muslims.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No-one should get away with this politics of grievance anymore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two: take on extremism in all its forms, the violent and non-violent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t become terrorists from a standing start.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It begins with preachers telling them that Christians and Muslims can&rsquo;t live together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It moves to people in their community saying the security services were responsible for 7/7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It progresses to a website telling them how to wage jihad, fight in Syria, and defeat the West.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And before you know it, a young British boy, barely 17, is strapping bombs to his body and blowing himself up in Iraq.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have to stop it at the start &ndash; stop this seed of hatred even being planted in people&rsquo;s minds, let alone allowing it to grow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three: we need to tackle segregation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are parts of Britain today where you can get by without ever speaking English or meeting anyone from another culture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zoom in and you&rsquo;ll see some institutions that actually help incubate these divisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you know, in our country, there are some children who spend several hours each day at a Madrassa?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me be clear: there is nothing wrong with children learning about their faith, whether it&rsquo;s at Madrassas, Sunday Schools or Jewish Yeshivas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But in some Madrassas we&rsquo;ve got children being taught that they shouldn&rsquo;t mix with people of other religions; being beaten; swallowing conspiracy theories about Jewish people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These children should be having their minds opened, their horizons broadened&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;not having their heads filled with poison and their hearts filled with hate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I can announce this today:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If an institution is teaching children intensively, then whatever its religion, we will, like any other school, make it register so it can be inspected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And be in no doubt: if you are teaching intolerance, we will shut you down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This goes to a wider truth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For too long, we&rsquo;ve been so frightened of causing offence that we haven&rsquo;t looked hard enough at what is going on in our communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is passive tolerance. And I&rsquo;ll tell you where it leads:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To children, British children, going to Pakistan in the summer holidays, before they&rsquo;ve even started their GCSEs, and forced to marry a man they&rsquo;ve never met&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;children, British children, having their genitals mutilated, not just in a clinic in Lagos but the backstreets in Britain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This passive tolerance has turned us into a less integrated country; it&rsquo;s put our children in danger. It is unforgiveable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So let me say it right here: no more passive tolerance in Britain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve passed the laws &ndash; now I want them enforced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People who organise forced marriages &ndash; I want them prosecuted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parents who take their children for FGM &ndash; I want them arrested.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And as we do that, we shouldn&rsquo;t just be saying what&rsquo;s wrong with these practices; we should be saying what&rsquo;s right with Britain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Freedom. Democracy. Equality. These are precious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People fought for them &ndash; many died for them&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;in the trenches, a century ago; on the beaches, 30 years later&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;in the Suffragettes; in Gay Pride.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Half the world is crying out for these freedoms &ndash; they see what we&rsquo;ve achieved with them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Free speech &ndash; and the best literature in the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Freedom of religion &ndash; and many faiths living side by side, peacefully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Free thinking &ndash; and the endless advances in medicine and technology that has brought.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A free economy &ndash; and a standard of living our grandparents could only have dreamed of.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want my children &ndash; I want all our children &ndash; to know they&rsquo;re part of something big &ndash; the proudest multi-racial democracy on earth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re making sure they learn British history at school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we started National Citizen Service to bring different people together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want them to grow up proud of our country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right: less Britain-bashing, more national pride &ndash; our way, the Conservative way, the only way to greater days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CONSERVATIVES</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So big battles. Big arguments. A Greater Britain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keeping our head as Labour lose theirs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I have a message for those who voted for us and those who never have:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you believe in strong defence, and helping the poorest, most desperate people in the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want an NHS that&rsquo;s there for everybody, and schools that stretch our children&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;and you understand none of that is possible without a strong economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you believe we can become the enterprise capital of the world and beat poverty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you believe that the fight against extremism is the fight for our existence; and you want this to be the generation that ends discrimination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want these things, the party you need is the party right here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s never too late.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bernard Harris from Leicester wrote to me before polling day and said this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aged 82, this is possibly my last election.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my life I have foolishly voted Labour, believing it served the working class.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How wrong I was. Labour is against all I aspire to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am 100 per cent for a United Kingdom, a sound economy, free enterprise, a trading Europe and a decent standard of living.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a Conservative Government will achieve this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bernard, you found the right party &ndash; and I want many more to follow in your footsteps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I believe that we can make this era &ndash; these 2010s &ndash; a defining decade for our country&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;the turnaround decade&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;one which people will look back on and say: &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the time when the tide turned&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;when people no longer felt the current going against them, but working with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can be that Greater Britain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because we know this: nothing is written.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve proved it in schools across our country&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;that the poorest children don&rsquo;t have to get the worst results &ndash; they can get the best.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the next five years we will show that the deep problems in our society &ndash; they are not inevitable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That a childhood in care doesn&rsquo;t have to mean a life of struggle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That a stint in prison doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;ll get out and do the same thing all over again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being black, or Asian, or female, or gay doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;ll be treated differently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nothing is written.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if we&rsquo;re to be the global success story of the 21st century, we need to write millions of individual success stories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Greater Britain &ndash; made of greater expectations&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;where renters become homeowners&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;employees become employers&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;a small island becomes an even bigger economy&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;and where extremism is defeated once and for all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Greater Britain&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;no more, its people dragged down or held back&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;no more, some children with their noses pressed to the window as they watch the world moving ahead without them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No &ndash; a country raising its sights, its people reaching new heights&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&hellip;a Great British take-off &ndash; that leaves no-one behind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s our dream &ndash; to help you realise your dreams.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Greater Britain &ndash; made of greater hope, greater chances, greater security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s get out there &ndash; all of us &ndash; and let&rsquo;s make it happen.</p></div>              </div>
