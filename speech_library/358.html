<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been hard to find words adequate</p>
<p>to give proper voice by way of response,</p>
<p>far less respect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can day-to-day vocabulary,</p>
<p>measure up to such sheer criminality?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me, watching those grim images on television &ndash; again, and again and again</p>
<p>&ndash; there were all the normal, human reactions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disbelief. Then alarm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Horror &ndash; as the truth sank in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compassion for all those people and all their families,</p>
<p>so many of whom, of course, were British.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you imagine that last mobile phone call</p>
<p>from your husband,</p>
<p>or wife or child?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The helplessness.  And with it,</p>
<p>the hopelessness.</p>
<p>Well, we&rsquo;re here because we don&rsquo;t believe</p>
<p>in hopelessness.</p>
<p>We actually believe in hope.</p>
<p>But hope requires purpose.</p>
<p>And purpose requires direction.</p>
<p>When I spoke again with the Prime Minister</p>
<p>earlier today,</p>
<p>we were clear on a number of matters.</p>
<p>First, common resolve</p>
<p>to root out terrorism wherever it may be.</p>
<p>Second, the need to balance legislation</p>
<p>with the interests of domestic civil rights.</p>
<p>Third, vigilance against anyone</p>
<p>who seeks to target and attack</p>
<p>any of our ethnic communities.</p>
<p>And fourth, no ruling out</p>
<p>of a further recall of Parliament,</p>
<p>if events require it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, immediate emotions inevitably begin to subside,</p>
<p>but they will never go away.</p>
<p>And nor should they.</p>
<p>But we Liberal Democrats must be clear</p>
<p>about our intentions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Resolve.</p>
<p>There cannot be capitulation to the terrorist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Determination.</p>
<p>That we strike at the heart of international terrorism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And equal determination,</p>
<p>Equal determination.</p>
<p>That in combating terrorism,</p>
<p>we do not lose sight of the fact,</p>
<p>at one at the same time,</p>
<p>that we live, actually, in a liberal democracy,</p>
<p>and the principles of democracy</p>
<p>are what we are all about.</p>
<p>So as we gather here this week,</p>
<p>this is one of the challenges facing us,</p>
<p>as Liberal Democrats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of our particular duties,</p>
<p>is to make it clear</p>
<p>that short-term knee-jerk responses,</p>
<p>never provide long-term solutions.</p>
<p>We have to point out</p>
<p>the humanitarian issues involved.</p>
<p>We have to be especially vigilant,</p>
<p>against those people</p>
<p>who would seek to make scapegoats,</p>
<p>of Muslims in Britain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us be quite clear,</p>
<p>we have no quarrel with the Muslim community,</p>
<p>and no quarrel with the Islamic faith.</p>
<p>Last Friday, when I visited a Mosque in London,</p>
<p>that was the message I took to our fellow citizens,</p>
<p>on all our behalves.</p>
<p>And that message went out loud and clear,</p>
<p>and very eloquently too,</p>
<p>from this conference hall this morning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But let us also remember.</p>
<p>That there will now</p>
<p>be particularly difficult dilemmas</p>
<p>ahead for our party.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those difficulties will involve a gauging</p>
<p>between the balance of the liberty of the individual</p>
<p>against the threat that the terrorist presents</p>
<p>to that very liberty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do not underestimate the real, ongoing pressures,</p>
<p>and the public scrutiny that goes with that,</p>
<p>which will be upon us in the times ahead.</p>
<p>Proportionate response</p>
<p>is not just about military measures.</p>
<p>Proportionate response</p>
<p>is also about civil liberties.</p>
<p>The scandal that is terrorism</p>
<p>is also about civil liberties.</p>
<p>In facing those dilemmas,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re best to remember our first principles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We subscribe to the rule of law,</p>
<p>violated over the skyline of the United States,</p>
<p>on September 11th.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But that subscription,</p>
<p>as the very word itself implies,</p>
<p>comes with a price tag attached.</p>
<p>It involves realism</p>
<p>and it involves risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Realism means facing the stark truth,</p>
<p>that the terrorist</p>
<p>will stop at nothing, absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Risk is about the consequences of your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So let us be clear about these first principles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Civil liberties &ndash; yes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rule of international law &ndash; yes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Co-operation amongst sane-minded peoples</p>
<p>across the globe &ndash; yes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But all underpinned</p>
<p>by a philosophic and a fundamental commitment</p>
<p>to the integrity of the individual,</p>
<p>and the supremacy of that individual</p>
<p>over the power of the nation state.</p>
<p>But recognising also,</p>
<p>that people need and are looking for &ndash;</p>
<p>right now as we speak &ndash;</p>
<p>security and reassurance,</p>
<p>and that the proper role of the state</p>
<p>is to provide just that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s where we stand.</p>
<p>And that defines our response</p>
<p>and our reasoning</p>
<p>in the wake of these dreadful, dreadful events.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Parliament was reconvened,</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but cast my mind back</p>
<p>to such a happy year as a student</p>
<p>in the mid-West of the United States.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Friendships were made there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What struck me then,</p>
<p>what I hadn&rsquo;t properly understood,</p>
<p>was the extent to which the mid-West</p>
<p>can almost be a country which is very different</p>
<p>from the rest of the country,</p>
<p>which is in itself,</p>
<p>when you think about it,</p>
<p>a continent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so what is so striking now</p>
<p>is this remarkable degree of spontaneous unity</p>
<p>right across America.</p>
<p>Coast to coast.</p>
<p>A unity of understandable anger.</p>
<p>But the fear that can flow from that,</p>
<p>can in itself be dangerous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s where a candid friend comes in.</p>
<p>Standing shoulder to shoulder, of course,</p>
<p>but always there,</p>
<p>for the occasional cautionary tap on the shoulder.</p>
<p>The most special relationships,</p>
<p>in my experience,</p>
<p>are based on a combination of two things;</p>
<p>trust and mutual respect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And as America&rsquo;s candid friend,</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re able to say,</p>
<p>there are no blank cheques</p>
<p>to be issued to the United States.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The way to defeat international terrorism,</p>
<p>is through international co-operation,</p>
<p>based on international law,</p>
<p>clear intelligence,</p>
<p>and a measured and appropriate military response.</p>
<p>All backed up,</p>
<p>by an appropriate concern,</p>
<p>for the humanitarian aspects,</p>
<p>of the crisis that we now face.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And let me say this</p>
<p>where military response is concerned.</p>
<p>We also have a duty and a responsibility</p>
<p>to ensure that where our armed forces are involved</p>
<p>the risks to them</p>
<p>are quantified and minimised.</p>
<p>We cannot shelve or abandon that requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That means supporting American actions,</p>
<p>only in the knowledge</p>
<p>that Britain will be involved</p>
<p>in all planning and risk assessment</p>
<p>All of that, we owe to our armed forces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if the first casualty of war is truth,</p>
<p>the purveyors of truth themselves</p>
<p>become especially important.</p>
<p>I refer of course, to the BBC World Service.</p>
<p>As ever, one of the key contributions</p>
<p>that Britain can make</p>
<p>to the coalition against terror and suppression</p>
<p>is to offer accurate information and rational analysis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But do remember.</p>
<p>War is not the word.</p>
<p>Nor is crusade.</p>
<p>Resolve is.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got to fashion a mindset,</p>
<p>to find that approach,</p>
<p>which begins to address the roots of such evil.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We do need to get back to those first principles.</p>
<p>In the face of such violation,</p>
<p>be inviolate.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t flinch.</p>
<p>Democracy must prevail and it will.</p></div>              </div>
